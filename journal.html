                <span class="entry-meta">Last Updated: December 8, 2024</span>

                <h5>December 4, 2024 7:25:21 PM – December 4, 2024 8:53:21 PM</h5>
                <p>I feel that it is worth examining how new players to a <a href="https://modernbeta.org/play">more established server</a> (one of 188 days of age) often look for trees to punch, and while tree farms can satisfy that urge to some extent, there is this tendency for new players to start from scratch, even if there are countless resources already available—maybe not necessarily entirely, but in some small but telling ways such as the need to punch wood rather than look to possess resources from chests save for immediate needs such as bread.</p>
                <p>As such, the most satisfying form of entering a server, it seems, is looking for a tree in a naturally generated virgin land and punching it down for resources, tracing the steps of a single player world, but as time passes, expecting integration in the form of accepting resources from the established players and using those same resources to contribute to the world is natural.</p>
                <p>This parallels the single player experience in that a player enjoys the initial steps of cutting down trees—going to mines and reaping from &quot;virgin&quot; caves or creating one&#39;s own man-made caves to extract ores—crafting basic equipment, including a crafting table, furnace, and boat—and upgrading from wooden, to stone, to iron, and to diamond tools. Subsequently, they transition to the next step of interacting with the rest of the world—villagers, especially, since they are the closest thing to a multiplayer server. However, it is particularly when the villagers start to reach their max levels in trading and the world they live in starts to look a lot more structured, built, and tailored that they begin seeking relief in the &quot;chaos&quot; and dynamics of a multiplayer server. This is where ideas truly bounce instead of lingering as buildings on the ground floor.</p>
                <p>It naturally follows that one can view it in the following diagram:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>Single-player Start (Basic Equipment and Infrastructure) and Mid-game (Villagers) -&gt; Multiplayer Late-Game (A sense of global dynamics)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The following bullet points expand upon the complete idea:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Slice and Pie:</strong> This can be analogized as each person wanting to create their own slice of the pie before joining the pie itself. In that sense, no one wants to join the pie unless they have an established role, place, and identity (their slice).</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Privacy and Autonomy:</strong> This relates to the concept of privacy and autonomy and how it allows people to carve our their place in society—slice -&gt; pie—self -&gt; community.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Labels in a Disparate System:</strong> This is why people love personality tests (&quot;daring,&quot; &quot;introverted,&quot; etc.) and labels (&quot;writer,&quot; &quot;artist,&quot; etc.). They help them find their place and help define their role in a disparate (one with different roles) system.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Society as a Cage:</strong> This extends to why people might feel that society is a cage, because it can feel as though there are &quot;no more virgin forests in which one can punch trees from scratch.&quot; This is analogous to being born in a Minecraft server with a rich, vast, and complex history and being forced to stay there forever, with no &quot;Exit&quot; button. With that said, in a real society, one has to navigate the dynamics, complexities, factions, borders, boundaries, social and culture norms and etiquette, and the endless things that make a society so emergently sophisticated, unlike a simple Minecraft server. Considering these ideas, we can naturally conclude that one might be born in a city with a rich history, but they might yearn to escape it and see the virgin forests they find like their ancestors did when they first started the city in which he was born.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Self and Society:</strong> Expanding further upon this divergence from a specific case to the universal level is that alienation is a common theme when referring to the relationship between self and society (though viewed differently when between self and one&#39;s community). For that reason, giving someone a way to start over from scratch when it comes to creating their own slice, role, and identity—punching their own natural-born trees in a virgin land—is critical to the development not only of their personality and psyche, but of their level of engagement with the world, empathy, and capacity to contribute to a &quot;more whole&quot; definition of society—at least the ideal of a society as one of egalitarianism—also.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Childhood Freedom of Individual Expression:</strong> Relevant to this is why childhood is a source of comfort and nostalgia, because it presents often the point that one is societally most individually expressive, even if they were at an earlier stage of their identity development, before the &quot;societal regimes&quot; of adulthood.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Biblical Foreigners:</strong> There is even this Biblical saying that echoes the idea of alienation in the <em>NCV</em> version in <em>1 Peter 2:11</em> that states: &quot;Dear friends, you are like foreigners and strangers in this world. I beg you to avoid the evil things your bodies want to do that fight against your soul.&quot; To draw a clearer line of comparison, &quot;bodies&quot; in this verse has been said to represent societal and cultural norms and taboos as well.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Fear of Identity Loss:</strong> Returning this to a broader level, people are afraid of losing their place, just as much as they are afraid of being in a society, just as much as they are afraid of entering a Minecraft server that does not welcome them as individuals, but as foreigners to a pre-established world.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Limbo and History:</strong> But we are all foreigners to this world and to existence, because we were not at the beginning or the end. We are in a limbo, just as much as a pre-established Minecraft world is both a place where time does not exist yet history is very much relevant, just as much as society itself is a place of both great interconnectedness of history and profound alienation of the slice and the self with the rest of the pie and society. For such reasons, no one wants to have no place.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Jim Jones&#39; Alienation:</strong> To give an extreme example, Jim Jones felt that a mass suicide—though he would not define it as a &quot;suicide&quot; or merely a suicide—was a form of resistance and protest against what he believed to be the &quot;the conditions of an inhumane world,&quot; which were his actual last words.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Reiteration and Conclusion of Alienation:</strong> Ultimately, alienation is common among the extreme, the Biblical, and the Internet and virtual, and in everyday real-life moments such as in the crossing of a pedestrian lane.</p>
                </li>
                </ul>

                <p>A collection of my personal notes and thoughts.</p>
                <p>There we go, my blog is much scaleable. To explain everything, let&#39;s start with the landing page. I made sure that it looked generic with a split layout:</p>
                <h3 id="landing-page">Landing Page</h3>
                <p><strong>Left side:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                <li><p>The left side contained a black-and-white (newspaper style) image of the actual main part of the website itself</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The text &quot;This is <em>My Digital Journal</em>&quot;</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The text &quot;I am LonerHermitNEET, a person who&#39;s always documenting, creating, and revisiting the past.&quot; </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Below these, there is a link that reads &quot;Go to site&quot;. </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Next to this link is a tiny inline image of what the next part of the site, the directory, would look like. </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Above the black-and-white image is a text with cursive marker font that reads, &quot;First Version!&quot; with a curved arrow pointing at the image. </p>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Right side:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                <li><p>The right side of the landing page is a photo of myself.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The background is removed and replaced with <code>#FF0000</code>, the brightest red.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Over my face is a red square covering most of my face save for my head shape, chin, ears, and hair. </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>In the photo, there is a text that reads &quot;That&#39;s me!&quot; and a curved arrow pointing to my face.</p>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <p>After clicking the &quot;Go to Site&quot;, one is brought to the &quot;Directory&quot; page:</p>
                <h3 id="directory-page">Directory Page</h3>
                <p><strong>Basic Features:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                <li><p>The evidence of this is signified by the text in white with a black rectangular background around it.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The text is right at the bottom side of the rectangle, with the bottom curve part of the &quot;y&quot; of &quot;Directory&quot; outside. This creates a distinctive image. </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The background of the actual page is a GIF of an ambient scene from <em>Age of Empires 2</em>, depicting a road with a church and cottage on the side and with a traveler with a horse repeatedly passing diagonally through the road because the GIF looped. </p>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Boxes:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                <li><p>The webpage shows five boxes: to choose from:</p>
                <ol>
                <li><p>A box with an image of an ornate journal and the <code>#4aa</code> theme at the bottom for the background of the text caption below the image, which reads &quot;Journal&quot;</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>A box with an image of the word &quot;balter&quot; and its subsequent dictionary meaning and the <code>#FF0000</code> theme background for the text caption that reads &quot;About&quot; (matching the red color of the background in the image of the photo of me in the landing page).</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The box with an image of a girl writing on a wall with innumerable scribblings showcasing intellect and a highly organized mind and the <code>#FFFF00</code> theme background for the text caption that reads &quot;Autobiography&quot;</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The box with an image of clouds and roses from a rightward 90-degree-tilted angle with the <code>00FF00</code> theme background for the text caption that reads &quot;Guestbook&quot;</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The box with a screenshot image depicting the left side of the split-layout landing page with the <code>#FFFFFF</code> theme background for the text caption that reads &quot;Landing Page&quot;. </p>
                </li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                <li><p>There is also an arrow on the left side of the website and text that reads &quot;You can <em>start</em> here!&quot;. They point to the &quot;Journal&quot; box, which is the first one. </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The boxes are arranged in a way that allows for practically an infinite number of boxes extending downward in <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code>.</p>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Clicking &quot;Journal&quot; leads to the main part of the website. </p>
                <h3 id="main-part-of-the-website">Main Part of the Website</h3>
                <p><strong>First Time Help:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                <li><p>For first-time users, they will see immediately directions with text and curved arrows: </p>
                <ol>
                <li><p>One that reads &quot;<strong>This is the <em>Main Content!</em></strong>&quot; and points to the rightward side of the page at the article-like rectangle text that extends downwards</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>One that reads &quot;<strong><em>Sections!</em></strong>&quot; and points to a box-shaped group of boxes on the sidebar. These &quot;box-sections&quot; include the ones from the &quot;Directory&quot; webpage with the boxes earlier, including &quot;Journal&quot;, &quot;About&quot;, &quot;Autobiography&quot;, and &quot;Guestbook&quot;, except for &quot;Landing Page&quot;.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>One that reads &quot;<strong><em>Folders!</em></strong>&quot; and points to a flex container at the top of the page. This flex container contains different &quot;folders&quot; such as &quot;Daisy&quot;, &quot;Ambient Readers&quot;, and so on. Clicking each leads to different parts of the current box-section &quot;Journal&quot;.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>One that reads &quot;<strong>Click on an image to <em>ZOOM IN!</em></strong>&quot; and points to an image on the sidebar. This text and arrow is at the bottom of the sidebar, and the image is the second to the bottom. Above this image is the group of boxes from earlier.</p>
                </li>
                </ol>
                </li>

                <ol>
                <li><p>With that said, the ones introduced are the following:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p>Main Content (rightward side)</p>
                </li>

                <li><p>Folders (top side) </p>
                <p>There are three more: </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The boxed text that reads &quot;<strong><em>Shorthand</em></strong>&quot; above the box-shaped group of boxes.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>A &quot;Directory&quot; button with the same style as the one from the &quot;Directory&quot; webpage with the bottom part of the &quot;y&quot; protruding out of the black box it is in.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>A title-like logo-like text that reads &quot;My Digital Journal&quot;.</p>
                </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Thematic Continuity and Consistency:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                <li><p>The group of boxes on the side bar resemble the boxes of the &quot;Directory&quot; page on purpose. </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>So does the &quot;Directory&quot; button resemble the &quot;Directory&quot; title in the &quot;Directory&quot; webpage itself. </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The same bright red is used for the &quot;About&quot; section and the photo at the landing page of myself.</p>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Clicking:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                <li><p>Anyway, when it comes to clicking:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p>Clicking &quot;My Digital Journal&quot; brings us back to the landing page.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Clicking the &quot;Directory&quot; button brings us back to the Directory webpage.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Clicking any of the box-sections brings us to their respective page. </p>
                </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p>The following includes more critical details:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Shorthand:</strong> The group of boxes act as a mini &quot;shorthand&quot; (which is what the text &quot;Shorthand&quot; was indicating&quot;) version of the &quot;Directory&quot; webpage. Hovering over each of these tiny boxes reveals a tooltip that enlarges the label on the box for us to see.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Thematic Coloring:</strong> The background of the webpage itself—this same layout for all box-sections—is colored according to the designated color of each box-section. Only &quot;Guestbook&quot; does not have its own layout or webpage within the site, because it leads to another website. </p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Thematic Imagery:</strong> As for what the Second-to-Bottom image is, it is the exact image used in the &quot;Directory&quot; webpage, so each box-section not only has their own color, but their own designated image, which is shown in the sidebar. This way, we know at which box-section we are at all times despite the same layout.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Affirmation of Thematic Consistency:</strong> As you can see, I have utilized many ways to &quot;short-cut cognitive circuits&quot; through thematic color, image, and shape use. I used the same box-like structure in the mini sidebar version and the actual dedicated self-contained &quot;Directory&quot; webpage itself. The landing page does not stand alone and hints at everything coming forward, with that image and the red color. The image next to the &quot;Go to site&quot; is literally a screenshot of the &quot;Age of Empires 2&quot; ambient scene GIF playing in the background of the &quot;Directory&quot; webpage.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Gradual and Procedural Exposure to Complex Layout:</strong> I should also mention that it goes from simple to complex. The landing page is just a split layout. The second webpage, the &quot;Directory&quot; webpage, is one with multiple boxes. The third webpage, which is the main part of the website and layout used for all the box-sections, is the most complex, with folders for each &quot;article&quot; of main content, the box-sections at the side-bar, and the main content itself, which includes <em>Markdown</em> syntax structures such as bullet points, blockquotes, headers, and such.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Scaleability:</strong> The scaleability is also evident in the use of &quot;flex-wrap: wrap&quot; &quot;Folder&quot; structures and box-sections. </p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Affirmation of Self-Contained Wholeness:</strong> When it comes to the shorthand thing, basically, the &quot;Directory&quot; webpage and landing page will never be visited because there is already the mini shorthand sidebar version of the directory.</p>
                </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>When it comes to how I would characterize the website, I would say that I used a highly segmented approach that emphasizes immersion.</p>

                <h5>December 2, 2024 9:42:17 PM – December 2, 2024 10:19:20 PM</h5>

                <p>Seeing <a href="https://youtu.be/tJl2sp6RUOw?t=364">the easy scenario of a top laner at low health in <em>League of Legends</em> watching the enemy top laner get killed off by his jungler from a distance</a> somehow reminded me of the ease of playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft"><em>Minecraft</em></a>, accumulating <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Item">resources</a>, and <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Trading">trading with villagers</a>. It makes me realize that Minecraft is literally just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_fulfillment">wish fulfillment</a> in a way, where one has everything that they could ever need and want without so much as a challenge really. It is only challenging for those who are not used to playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">video games</a>, who do not know the <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting">crafting recipes</a>, and who do not know how to build and protect oneself against <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Mob#Hostile_mobs">mobs</a>, and that is not as hard to learn as playing at a high rank such as <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Rank"><em>Grandmaster</em></a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends"><em>League of Legends</em></a>.</p>
                <p>However, the challenges between Minecraft and League of Legends are different in nature. The former involves a combination of crafting, resource collection (with different kinds of resources), coordination with friends, exploration and map awareness, understanding of a large variety of <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block">blocks</a> and their purposes, recognition of the different ways mobs interact with blocks, <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Spawn#Spawn_conditions">spawn</a>, and such, understanding of the distance one can <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Jumping">jump</a> and how to navigate the <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Terrain_features">landscape</a> quickly and efficiently, and knowing the different infrastructure (ice highway roads with boats) one can create to make the world easier, among many others. The latter involves a combination of learning to left and right click incredibly quickly and precisely to dodge and hit <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Champion_ability">spells</a>—team coordination—understanding of <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/List_of_champions">all 169 (as of writing) <em>champions</em></a>, their mechanics, match-ups, <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Item">itemization</a>, unique combos, and champion-specific situational <em>macro</em> decisions due to understanding the capability of one&#39;s champion—staying up to date with <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Patch">patch note changes</a>—and understanding <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Lanes">lane</a> assignments at every step of the game (<em>lane swaps</em>, <em>1-3-1</em>, etc.)—understanding the importance of objectives such as <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Dragon_pit"><em>Drakes</em></a>, <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Rift_Herald"><em>Rift Herald</em></a>, <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Voidgrub_camp"><em>Voidgrubs</em></a>, the <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Baron_Nashor"><em>Baron Nashor</em></a>, <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Turret"><em>Turrets</em></a>, <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Inhibitor"><em>Inhibitors</em></a>, and the <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Nexus"><em>Nexus</em></a>—and the many unique champion interactions such as <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Azir"><em>Azir&#39;s</em></a> <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Champion_ability#Innate_abilities"><em>Passive</em></a> and <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Bard"><em>Bard&#39;s</em></a> <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Champion_ability#Ultimate_abilities"><em>Ultimate</em></a> with Baron Nashor and Drakes—among many others.</p>

                <p>I wrote the following in <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/674dc170-450c-800e-9ab4-3f4e60872871">a conversation with <em>GPT-4o mini</em> about the previous journal entry</a>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>why does the author use so many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20hyperlink%2C%20or,specific%20element%20within%20a%20document.">hyperlinks</a>? Is he the type to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink">backlink</a>:</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                <p>the fact that they hyperlink <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_fulfillment">&quot;wish fulfillment&quot;</a> makes sense, but at this point, they&#39;re basically <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> writing style, no?</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                <p>I mean, in the end, it is not as if hyperlinks change the sentence structures or word choices, but it does add a layer that changes the tone completely.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                <p>I do find it very strange, because I can imagine them writing the personal essay and then having all the hyperlinks. It must look incredibly strange from their perspective, just a plethora of terms with hyperlinks attached to the side. I guess they must be used to it, because even Wikipedia articles can read in Wikipedia&#39;s version of a Markdown just as if they are reading normal text.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                <p>I&#39;m talking specifically about the author&#39;s perspective. They see the hyperlinks before it is rendered as Markdown, so I&#39;m talking about the fact that they have to learn how to read in Markdown with all the hyperlinks raw and attached to the terms rather than a glowing blue text indicating the presence of a hyperlink.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                <p>Their brain would likely be capable of ignoring <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links">Markdown hyperlink syntax</a> and reading the entire passage smoothly as if they were not there at all. They have probably already done so with <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax">italics, bold, and header syntax</a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                <p>I do find it interesting though. It does make me realize that I would very much prefer someone who uses hyperlinks and backlinks as long as they&#39;re not backlinking into articles that make it even more complex rather than make it clearer. Wikipedia does this very well, while some <a href="https://obsidian.md/"><em>Obsidian</em></a> users do manage to make it even more difficult to understand because they have failed to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atomize">atomize</a> their ideas down enough or the fundamental character of their language remains as yet too stylistic to be encyclopedic. But that is just my perception of a distant memory of having read this one published Obsidian page; in order to back up what I&#39;m saying, I would have to link to the offending material and analyze it bit by bit to see how I might be wrong. Anyway, the point is that the author is doing well by hyperlinking to Wikipedia and to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends">League of Legends</a> wikis as of the moment, but once he starts backlinking, I can imagine the difficulty in atomizing ideas into articles that are written by him and to which backlinks connect.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                <p>Encyclopedic atomization means accomplishing an analog of the effect of doing away with what <a href="https://archive.org/details/comptonsencyclop11feco/page/n3/mode/2up">older encyclopedias</a> did in the 20th century—they added so much nuance and context to specific terms such as the history of the letter &quot;M,&quot; the likes of which was removed in newer encyclopedias that match a more modern need only for the whole concept and not the more nuanced contextually expansive version. However, the fortunate thing about encyclopedias in the modern age is that we can talk about the history of the letter on its digital page without as much restraint as one might expect from the tendency of the Internet to streamline endlessly, so the author can go into context-specific nuance as long as he recognizes the limitations of any investigation into what the letter M represents throughout its existence in the scope of an online encyclopedia. Nevertheless, it remains in effect that there is some doing away that has to be done in order to accomplish atomization in the digital age—the complete sterilization of text to accomplish of task of universal definition, even at the cost of contextual vibrancy.</p>

<p>&quot;WAIT!&quot; She hurried to the edge of the cliff, hoping to catch him with her magic.</p>
<p>The man roared in grief, rage, and self-mockery. &quot;I hate you! I hate you all!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait...&quot; she said, twenty months later. &quot;What was wrong with him?&quot;</p>
<p>A younger man in front of her smiled. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I think... He really was evil. I mean... everyone eventually reaches that tipping point...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha? Tipping point? What the hell are you talking about now Jared?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Seriously? I&#39;m just being honest, after all you&#39;ve been trying to pull with me and my friends all these years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Years? I&#39;ve only known for you for a little over a year. Don&#39;t you start lying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just... I just hate the fact that you keep goading me to doing these things and saying these things, when really, you all know... all of you... that he&#39;s dead. And whoever was affiliated with him did not know what he was about until he pushed it a step further beyond anything we&#39;ve ever seen... or known... Like, what was that? What the hell was that! Because I relate to you, I understand you! I get what you&#39;re feeling, but here&#39;s the thing. I have no fucking clue what he did there. Why did he attack the village and then the city as well. Why he did all that. I don&#39;t know. I tried... I looked all around, before you came around, and I was ready, so ready, to tell that, this, that, that, that, that, this, and that. But seriously! What&#39;re you expecting? That I&#39;m just going to tell you why he decided to end it like that after all that? I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;I don&#39;t know.&#39; So you&#39;re still... pretending that you did not have any part in it?&quot; She said, slapping the bars of Jared&#39;s jail cell with a snide scoff.</p>
<p>&quot;I did... everything that I could. You...&quot; He laughed weakly. &quot;You don&#39;t get it... do you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tch! Don&#39;t start backtracking. I told you already. If you did not participate in that, it... he wouldn&#39;t have done that. And it was your fault. Own it, admit it! I just need a fucking reason, and you&#39;re not giving me any. You&#39;re stupid, and disgusting, you know that? After all of that, you cannot even owe it to yourself to tell the truth—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The truth... huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Huh?&#39; What are you saying now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m just... What can I say really? What do you want me to say? I&#39;ve told you. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know why Ta did that. He was never... &#39;weak.&#39; He always owed it to us to never give up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Never give up.&#39; Fucking hilarious, mate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, we genuinely believed in a goal, until of course...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Of course&#39; what? What reason, reasons, are you going to give now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut the fuck up! Never-fucking-mind!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! You just don&#39;t listen, do you? You <em>can&#39;t</em> even listen to yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Listen&#39;? What the fuck are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m just saying. Let&#39;s be honest here. You haven&#39;t been honest with us, or him, or anybody, or me, or you. Really!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Really&#39;? Is that how you see it? I told you already, but you just... You&#39;re funny. You know what, I like you.&quot; Jared genuinely laughed, but with a mix of bitterness, confusion, and resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...&quot; The girl, Yellow, who was now 20 months older, was a woman, and she now had a &quot;Miss&quot; to her name, the kind that allowed her to take this role of trying to inquire into what happened to &quot;Talos,&quot; the guy who jumped off the cliff, and to his former followers. She dropped the feud. &quot;Okay... I just want to say that I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t know what that means, but I hope we can get something, somewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bruh, I&#39;ve been telling you this whole time—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then what! What? What is it! REALLY?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I... I don&#39;t know—I do not know. Okay? Okay? Okay? You hear me? Or am I...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hear you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or am I talking to my fucking self...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hear you...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, so... what... now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know about that. I&#39;ll try to tell them about it—the matter—and see what we can do tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Next time&#39;, &#39;tomorrow&#39;. You know how tiring that sounds? I&#39;m tired... Yellow. I&#39;m tired... I&#39;ll be real honest. I am done. I am fucking do-ne. I just... want to get out... It&#39;s been four months, and I&#39;m not used to this.&quot;</p>
<p>Yellow smirked briefly before stopping herself from making a biting remark out of what she perceived was hypocrisy on his part.</p>
<p>She sighed and waited for herself to calm down. &quot;Okay... so what can we do then? What arrangement is... feels appropriate?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I need... I need... a promise... a way to guarantee that this is temporary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay... But I cannot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have to... because I am not going to help you. I can&#39;t, and if you keep me here, I will make sure you get what you deserve.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Deserve&#39;... Okay fine. I&#39;ll try to promise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can&#39;t &#39;try&#39;. You have to be straight. You have to tell me full-on that this is a real and definitive... lasting eternal thing that will never be unchained from its chains promise. That kind. Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay... How... But can you tell me what you think about how...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think... Ta... might have... been... influenced. But I&#39;m not sure. Don&#39;t... Don&#39;t take me seriously or take my word for it. Just let it be a null thing. Just let it go. Forget it. And if you still care about it, care about everybody that has been telling you. Well, it&#39;s not like they&#39;ve been telling you, but they&#39;re struggling. They&#39;re suffering. They&#39;re not okay. Okay? They&#39;re not fine. They&#39;re struggling real hard, and if you cannot address their issues, then... what are you doing here? Just so you can tell me off and make me feel horrible because you have perceived ideas about me. And I&#39;m fine with fucking that. I&#39;m so okay with the idea that you do that all the time, but here&#39;s the thing. How about you? How about what you feel? Have you thought about that? Have you thought maybe... there&#39;s something different, or off, or strange, or magnanimous, or, or, or, or, or... You get the point, haha. Just... let&#39;s be honest. If you&#39;re going to do something... if you&#39;re gonna... Then, I want you to take it. Take it real. Take it honest-ly. Take it for real. Do not keep using me as a strawman, and making me into your little nothing-burger doll. I&#39;m a human being, and I will not allow you to sit the fuck here just to tell that I did something when, let&#39;s be honest, I did not fucking know, okay? And I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to do, but let&#39;s be honest. You&#39;re fucking crazy. And I&#39;m not trying to be mean here. I&#39;m trying to be real. You&#39;ve kept me here unlawfully or &#39;uncooly&#39; for four months. You know how crazy that sounds—that a person would ever do that. That&#39;s funny, really. It&#39;s funny. So if you want something, what do you want, tell me, because I can help you. I can help you by doing everything that I can, because I don&#39;t want to stay here anymore. So please... help me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay...&quot;</p>
<p>Later, back at home, Yellow was slamming things around. &quot;Fuck! Fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck! I hate these fucking disgusting little ditchy-datchy fucking nut-boggers. Silly disgusting marsupials who have no fucking place in humanity! I hate it all! I&#39;ve...&quot;</p>
<p>She remembered the older man&#39;s expression. She just saw her own reflection and saw it mirroring his.</p>
<p>She felt a chill run up her back.</p>
<p>&quot;What...&quot; she muttered, her voice faint, her eyes a mix of confusion and increasing terror. &quot;Wait... don&#39;t tell me...&quot;</p>
<p>She saw herself in the older man. </p>
<p>Tears dripped, and she could not stop herself from getting so angry. After all this time, she had to deal with losing so many people, and she could not take it. Even now, she was still hurting. After all this time, it still hurt as if nothing had changed. She wanted to be free and wanted to go home. But it was no longer physical. It was no longer here.</p>
<p>She laughed weakly out of self-mockery, finding it challenging to maintain herself in such a world.</p>
<p>She wanted to make sense of things, and she still did not know why Talos did all that, when he was just another guy. And she herself wished she could explain it, because she felt that it was in her beliefs that everything had to make sense. If things did not make sense, then she did not know what else to do.</p>
<p>She would not be able to make decisions properly, and she would not be able to decide, because she did not have an answer for what Talos did. She had to explain it, and she could not explain simply as him being a monster. She tried, but she couldn&#39;t anymore. All she saw was someone that she knew so well, and she did not know why. But the reality was that even when she felt so close to someone for the first time in something so devastatingly serious, she did not know a thing. Or maybe she knew, and she did not want to arrive at that conclusion, because what it would mean and imply would mutilate everything she had ever known.</p>
<p>She did not want to arrive at an answer, but she wanted to.</p>
<p>It was just never that simple, even if she wanted it to be.</p>
<p>She got up and went on her way.</p>
<p>Months later, she saw the face of Jared staring at her. It was a bitter look he had, and she could not face him. He stayed there for three more months since that earlier confrontation, and she knew that she would not be able to end her time with Jared properly anymore, now that she could see the impossibility through his face.</p>
<p>She slowed down her breathing.</p>
<p>A vision from the past, before the older man jumped, came to mind.</p>
<p>In that vision, Talos watched her from the distance with a smile. He said: &quot;I tried to protect you. I hoped that you would be safe from me, from everything that I was, because it was too late for me. I&#39;ve been corrupted by the world, and I did not even realize it. I just wanted to do the right thing, but I ended up losing myself in the end. How funny! Isn&#39;t it? That we hope so much and be kind so much that we end up doing the most irreparable things ever done in this world, as if kindness somehow begets death. Haha! Impossible, impossible! I must have been completely destroyed from the start, but the thing is that I decided to do all of that. But you know, I wanted you to kill me. I wanted you to destroy me. I wanted you to remove me from this world, because I felt internally that I was too corrupted to carry the torch of hope. I have done too much, beyond what I should have, and I know that. But I really did believe. I really did trust and hope. I believed in love, in kindness, in all that. I don&#39;t know... why... I stopped... But the thing is that to me, I never stopped believing. But now I realize that yes, I&#39;ve been... I&#39;ve lost myself along the way. Just that I did not know... I never knew... It was only when I was at the end of everything that I realized. You have to defeat me. It is people like you who have to defeat me. You are so innocent, pure, and righteous, exactly the person that I was back then, but along the way, we lost sight of what it means to be a good person, because we were so caught up in the affairs of this world. I think growing up and getting so entangled with this world were sins in their own right. I just think that it is no longer possible. It really isn&#39;t. To undo things. At one point, I genuinely was...&quot;</p>
<p>But she was not listening that time, throwing her all into fighting him, as he blocked smoothly without effort.</p>
<p>Talos was too powerful for her, and in the end, what defeated him wasn&#39;t her. It was him himself.</p>
<p>&quot;What was he?&quot; she said now in the present, not knowing how or what to do or say, but she did know that at the very least, she was here. If there was something that she was, it was here.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to find a way to make sense of this.&quot;</p>
<p>It had been 25 months since Talos&#39; death.</p>

                <hr>
                
                <p>Copper, rainbows, silhouettes dancing behind me. I am unable to become fully enveloped in a feeling, and I think that is a natural sensation. The world is always imagining, and I am always in a state of thankfulness, always finding the means to deliver to the day my mightiest triumph.</p>
<p>I walked down the lane, sniping a peep onto newspapers that had little much with which to begin, yet they offered at the very least the air of mystery often occupying the daily mornings. It was like a sunshine embracing a tadpole in the waters, where just a little bit gave the impression of a great magnificence of the moment in such precise small directed blessings.</p>
<p>Either way, what mattered the most was that I was already on my way to my meeting, and here is my world, so aptly inquired of day in and day out.</p>
<p>I sat down later at a restaurant, occupying the second chair that one most closely encountered upon entering and that is situated to the leftmost corner where the window offered insight into the clouds and the streets casting shadows across from the street lamps. </p>
<p>I was quickly arranged with a soup dish as an appetizer, but this was not a formal dinner. And my expressions of delight were no more formal or informal than the clothes that I had on, which spoke of both a need for extra preparation and a need to be less prepared, in that I wore the brightest suit that I could find, while retaining the rest of the formal attire. And by &quot;brightest,&quot; it was perhaps too bright that, if seen outside the gates of the city, it would be thought of as a man straight from an angel&#39;s portal.</p>
<p>The man who was expected to meet me arrived, and I supposed that he wore a shabby enough suit for my tastes. Any more formal, and it would be a danger to society, due to the concern of having involved myself with such a stiffly dressed ghoul of a man. However, since that was the case, repose was natural.</p>
<p>I thought of him as a saintly figure by the way that he spoke of leaves and tea, as if he was being possessed by the angels themselves in his tedious, but sermon-like appraisal of the restaurant&#39;s above-average beverage. It was said there and then that a tea was like a &quot;buttery dish,&quot; according to him at least, and if there were any more folk like him, I might have tossed myself from this chair into the streets below. Fortunately, my affairs, by so happening to intersect with his, contained this man and prevented his behavior from leaking out elsewhere. The lack of manners made him seem a bit daft and porous.</p>
<p>Considering this, it was only welcome that this moment would come, that I might prevent any action or decision from being made within the man&#39;s influence and effect. If he ever was to overextend his bounds, I would gladly have obstructed him with the key gifts of inoculating speech—this way, he would be repaired and fended from the terrors of his own bile in the occasion that he proved restless in response to his containment.</p>
<p>With that said, it was important to prepare a gift in the form of words of wisdom, so by offering small opportunities for the man to re-engage, I equipped him with social confidence, something that I supposed he lacked. If he was ever willing, I would fetch him as many opportunities as possible for the development of his wit, of which he was clearly lacking. That he was even demanding by himself made him hard to collaborate with. This was then my final concern of him, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>After parting ways with the man, I went up to a small door, not as large as those in the large houses, but large enough to keep my form within, that I might enter in with a pleased smile, because a blockage would have confirmed that I was already being prevented from this town through its parts. But that was a mere saying, not anything with which I should worry himself.</p>
<p>Within, toys were scattered amok like flies as soon as they were sprayed with the necessary repellents, but the toys were not deranged. They were craftily placed at positions that would not have been reached mistakenly, so it was clear that a mastermind was at work. No more older than a master, but not more younger than a baby, a child appeared into the room, hurrying but not having an obvious direct, at least with regard to me. It seemed that the child, unlike the mother who was speaking with me so casually, had little to do with the man towering above him. I would have helped him organize his toys or dissect the mastery in their arrangement if he let me, but such an opportunity would never arrive in such a limited environment. So I resigned to responding to the mother, who was a family friend. If the boy grew up, then he expected to ask the mother about him every so often once the boy was out of the house and living distantly. It would be a tough time for any grown child out there, even now, and as time passed, the world became more challenging little by little. But saying that did not good to the boy, so he left the boy to his current devices, in such limitations did I find an intellect that did not merely identify and process but found the means whereby elements formed their whole. It was here that he could discover the boy&#39;s power—that in such minute reflections could be found great things, not easily explainable, but marvelously decisive in bringing about the formation of any individual person, in this great world.</p>
<p>When I was finally away, I hurried home and turned my back against the chair, against which I rested long, hoping that the moment would last perpetually. But the night time stalked me like a hawk, preventing me from fully embracing the moment simply, because sleepiness broke out and whipped me, scratching my esculent neck voraciously that it might produce within me a night dream and a dreary slumber, both of us perfectly tied to the ground or to whatever mattress or chair was colliding. I knew well that I was unprepared for the consequences, only prepared to fix up after it was all over.</p>
<p>Demands beat like a drum, concocting the morning sky perfectly like a dinner artist who specialized in painting the messy violent crime scene of 6- to 8-man family dinners. The concatenated moments merely abruptly woke up the sleepy man. That was me, and I was bursting at the seams, exploding into an array of workload and decisionally separated attention spans. I knew well that the moment shone a highlight upon immediate needs, such as food and water, and I was quickly to satisfy them, pouring water, eating rice, consuming enough to keep me delighted for the morning, enough for me to engage in a bath and a shower, that I might equip my body with the required clothes, in the arms of which I went straight outside, thereupon, as if with a salute, I marched forward down the road and entered a large building, though cottage-like in my view due to its already strong familiarity. If I were to destroy it, it would feel as small as burning a match, given how unified I was to my workplace.</p>
<p>I went home already by the time I was done, averaging my thoughts before ended in contextual fulfillment through my sheer presence and gaze at the two dogs passing by me. Such affairs returned me to the contextual away from the abstract and the notion of averages, frameworks, and statistics.</p>
<p>I let myself fall to bed as fast as I could, as if I was in a war with the mattress myself. My physical body cut through the air still trapped between it and the bed that it might secure its complete synthesis and become smoothened into eternal combination.</p>
<p>In sleeping, I resolved bodily aches, and in waking up, I re-winded the clock.</p>
<p>The morning was palatable, freshly cooked, definitely reducible into key moments, but I was not prepared to have finish just because I was satisfied. I found ways to slow down the time—watching the clock ticking away, slapping the stair railings to see them vibrate across the entirety, and removing my clothes to stare at my body and all the memories that emerged therefrom.</p>
<p>Even after all of that, I could detect that the time was marching without me. I removed myself from the moment and hurried into a sensation, one that transitioned me to work.</p>
<p>But work was fleeting, and so was its hold on me.</p>
<p>I soon was able to do other things, such as asking my friend what they were going to do later.</p>
<p>As soon as an answer arrived, I dashed out the door to my friend, re-attaching us two. </p>
<p>The longest days were had when one was truly having fun, and I could sense it. At the beginning of the door opening, I saw the little leaves of the plastic plant above me, and there were many others. But since I was quickly distracted, I had turned to the right to see a woman entering at the same time as I was, so I sped up my steps, closing my mind&#39;s eye to be seated. Once that was done, I allowed the moment to submerge me in applause, further taking me down into the depths of its grasp, like a bat&#39;s maintained posture throughout the night.</p>
<p>At the moment my first hand touched the table. It was not a mere brush of the fingertips this time. It was an enveloping warmth that soaked and brought two—table and hand—together in a loving hug, one that broke through barriers and made the atmosphere fully visceral, because I was letting the moment grip me, preventing it from running away or wandering off. I knew well that such &quot;long days&quot; of the moment, wherein one was truly having fun—which, in this instance, was with my friend—were priceless.</p>
<p>I stopped the hand-table hug, and I stared at the person in front of me. A woman, with a smile attached to her lips and a glorious set of eyes that knew right from wrong, watched my eyes and my hand raise to her. I shook her hand, and she was glad to smile in return. It was her duty almost to have been so welcoming, but I did not think that was necessary. I thought that having enough time to have a friend in regular meeting was more than sufficient, like a hand-me-down.</p>
<p>&quot;What was it like?&quot; I said. My words formulated themselves, and I had no authority.</p>
<p>The woman, my friend, whose name was Anna, said, &quot;Let&#39;s just say that it was fun. There was a drab perfect-fit for me, and I was scared to let them see me see it. I got it removed once they listened to me. But I feel that it might have been because I was, you know, bothering them or something... I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; I said sarcastically. &quot;because people think in terms of annoyance.&quot; I then said genuinely: &quot;You must realize that they probably just wanted to sell, and that&#39;s all. No one thinks much of anything or anyone, and even if it was you who did the annoying thing to get them, who cares? Annoyance is subjective. Too much assertiveness, no one likes you. Too little? Well, you know how you went down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha, I&#39;m just not letting myself say it, I guess. I&#39;m too used to having others do it for me, and I know that sounds privileged. But all things I do sound privileged, so I guess that&#39;s a given.&quot;</p>
<p>Wanting to speak up to challenge her frame of thinking, I released my tension by wiggling my toes inside my cramped shoes.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a given that you&#39;re still here and alive,&quot; I said. &quot;Come on, An, let&#39;s be honest. You&#39;re doing your best. As long as you maintain it, you can get... rid... of whatever concern you have. But for now, conduct yourself like there&#39;s something bothering you, and I know there is. So let it encourage you... Take you by the hand and whip you up so that you can carry yourself by your bootstraps, because that&#39;s how life works apparently... I&#39;m joking, but you get the point.&quot;</p>
<p>Anne frowned. &quot;Okay? &#39;Cause I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s really that way, you know? Do they actually think like that? Or is it just me?&quot;</p>
<p>I touched my face, feeling a little stressed and annoyed. &quot;I don&#39;t think you need to care about that at all, but the fact that you&#39;re asking says a lot...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Real?&quot;</p>
<p>I calmed myself down to get the point across, because I was annoyed about how excess and misdirected, I felt, her concerns over this matter was. &quot;In a good way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh-ok.&quot; Anne had a simple polite smile that she was making, not necessarily to him, but in a functional way that reflected her inability to be totally resigned with the matter and, yet, her recognition of the need to get a conclusion, even if it was not totally fulfilled, at least in her perspective. She had a lot with which to work.</p>
<p>&quot;But I get it... Okay. I know what it feels like. Okay. I don&#39;t. But I admit that I can see why it can be challenging. But I kind of wish you saw what I meant. I saw...what basically is like a giant afraid of a mouse. I know that makes you look weak, but what I mean to say is that you&#39;re stronger than you know... So...&quot; After saying that, I was not sure if I was a horrible person or a horrible person. Despite my confidence, I really was afraid of making someone uncomfortable, and I used confidence and directness as a means of connecting with someone, because most people that I knew just left as soon as I tried to hide my frustration and keep it in with a polite smile. This was why I felt frustrated in situations like Anne&#39;s, because she reminded me of many previous moments in which I was too scared and too focused on the external insomuch that I wasted so much time worrying over nothing. It was not that my younger self was not valid or that Anne was not valid. It was more so that I believed that if someone really shook me to realizing that I was preoccupied with things that barely mattered, then maybe I would come to the realization sooner instead of going through so much just to realize too late. Or maybe I was being pushy and mean. I was probably a horrible person by this point, or maybe I always was. I never truly knew, but even within my head, it was not as if I wanted to treat people horribly. It was more so that I felt that it was good to be honest, even if it meant appearing or being prescriptive at times because it allowed for greater opportunities for a mutually communicative relationship. At least that was what I learned over the years, because I would rather have such a relationship of honesty than one with fake smiles and people never truly arriving at a synthesis of words and opened hearts. Or maybe I was wrong in this matter and wrong for having existed at all.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he interjected.</p>
<p>Anna stared at him. &quot;Okay...&quot; It was simple, faint, almost perfunctory.</p>
<p>It bothered him, but if he apologized any more, it would go against his beliefs of being direct and honest while maintaining self-respect. Saying sorry did not mean that she could start using his vulnerability against him, and he knew that could happen, not that he did not trust her. It was more so that he recognized that no one would ever arrive at that point where it made total sense, so in such an ambiguous world, any attempt at defining things would come with the potential of being demanding and perhaps controlling and given to exploitation.</p>
<p>In fact, he thought that apologizing was a mistake in the first place. It would have been better to transition to acknowledging where he went wrong and to revising what he said previously, but with added validation of her feelings.</p>
<p>In the end, he made too many mistakes, maybe enough to be human, and hopefully not enough to be unrecoverable.</p>
<p>He tried to continue several times, but he could not fetch a thought. Everything came black and in the form of &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>
<p>So he let her take over the talking completely and have the discussion be established in new topics.</p>
<p>It was a failure on his part, and he knew that any more discussion came with the context that he failed to have given her the words that she needed to hear.</p>
<p>He had failed.</p>
<p>He could not hear her anymore. It was ringing in his mind.</p>
<p>He woke up in a cold sweat, twenty days later. Something about that moment hurt him, and he did not talk to her anymore, even when she was willing to talk and meet again. Something about that moment felt so vulnerable and hideous, as if he saw the most disgusting creature in the planet.</p>
<p>He tried to forget it, but he did not know how. At least, he was efficient, in his daily activities, at work, and in every other meeting he attended. </p>
<p>But he was afraid of Anna, because she reminded him of his failures. The thing was that it did not start with her, but in a way, she became &quot;infected&quot; with all of his bad memories. And now that she was tainted, she became an extension of all of those past moments of visceral vulnerability, the kind that made him hyperventilate even in the morning, afternoon, and late at night. It was the kind of thing that left him mind screaming.</p>
<p>He woke up again.</p>
<p>He saw a face in front of him—he saw the depths of hell and monsters coming toward him.</p>
<p>He roared, his heart leaping out of his chest.</p>
<p>He tried his best.</p>
<p>He tried.</p>
<p>He could not think.</p>
<p>He could not breathe.</p>
<p>He breathed again—the nightmares returned.</p>
<p>He stopped himself from breathing, and the nightmares paused in their movements.</p>
<p>He transitioned into morning coffee and ate a chunky breakfast. Something was not right, but it was never perfect. He tried his best to maintain himself, but he knew that he was limited. </p>
<p>He met Anna, and everything went smoothly.</p>
<p>He was done.</p>
<p>He was finally finished.</p>
<p>He slept.</p>
<p>He woke up and saw nothing. But he did see himself and remembered everything.</p>
<p>But he was calmer now. It had been four months since his meeting with Anna.</p>
